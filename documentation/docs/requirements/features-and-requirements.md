# Features and Requirements

## Functional Requirements

1. Language Learning Discord Bot (will be abbreviated to LLDB going further) will require a Discord account to use.
    * Requirements for making a Discord account include having an email address, and being of 13 years of age or older.
    * Discord can be downloaded onto the computer, or be accessed via the web @ https://discord.com/app

2. The LLDB will require being in the server with the bot. 
    * To accomplish this, one must join a server that hosts the bot or invite the bot into a server of their choosing.
    * LLDB Team will host the bot here @ https://discord.gg/zW5RbpbTT

3. Communicating with the bot will require an internet connection.
    * A stable connection is necessary for voice input/output; but for learning via text, it is not necessary.

4. Starting setup for the bot includes just selecting a starter language to begin. 
    * This language can be changed at a later date if desired by sending "/changeLanguage".

5. The full command list for the bot can be viewed by sending "/help" in to the chat while the bot is active.
    * Viewing the command list will let you see all possible options to learn with the bot.

6. To access a vocab quiz with the selected language, simply prompt the bot via sending "/startVocabQuiz". 
    * This will allow the user to select a level to start with; the higher the level number, the more difficult the words will be.
    * For example, level 1 might include "talkative", whereas level 7 might include "gregarious" by comparison.
    * After selecting the level, the bot will generate a practice test for the user to attempt.

7. To access pronounciation practice, prompt the bot via sending "/startVoiceQuiz".
    * To use this command, one must be in a voice channel on the server.
    * Furthermore, the bot must have permissions to access the voice channel; this can be done by giving the bot the permission or making the voice channel visible to the bot.
    * The bot will join the voice channel and transcribe the user's audio transmission.
    * The user will then be graded on their attempt.

8. The language leaderboard can be checked via "/leaderboard".
    * This will display the current top aggregate scores of all users.
    * These scores are increased when completing vocab and voice quizzes with the highest possible scores.
    * To check an individual's scores across all quizzes, send "/myScores".
    * The leaderboard will be specific to each language; there will be a different leaderboard for each different language.
