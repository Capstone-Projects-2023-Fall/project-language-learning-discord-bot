This diagram illustrates the structure of individual documents in our MongoDB database. The documents are as follows:

- The 'users' document contains information about user progress, study history, scores, language preferences, and other user settings.
- The 'progresses' document stores information about default progress based on language. This includes the setup for units and lessons.
