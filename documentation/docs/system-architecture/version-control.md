# Version Control
- GitHub will be utilized as the version control system for LDB

- The master branch will be protected. 
    - No developer can commit changes directly to the master branch.
    - All changes made on another branch will require another developer's review/ok before merging into the master branch.

- Each additional feature of the application will be given its own branch and manipulated using Jiras built-in GitHub functionality.

- All code changes will be pushed into each developer's feature-based branch before it is sent to the master branch.
