# Component Descriptions
A description the different components and their interfaces. See the [System Block Diagram](https://capstone-projects-2023-fall.github.io/project-language-learning-discord-bot/docs/requirements/system-block-diagram) for a visualization of how these components interact.

## Discord API
An API that allows interactions with various features on Discord 
such as chatting and user authentication. We will use Discord's API 
to facilitate communication with users and receive commands.
	
## unittest
Python library used to write and run unit tests. In the context
of our project, we will be testing specific bot commands and
performing integration testing.

## mongoDB
A NoSQL database management system. We will use mongoDB to
store user's selected language as well as current progress.

## Web Hosting [Specific host in later sprint]
Web Hosting allows for the bot to be more reliable and consistent. 
We will host the Discord bot on TBD so the bot can be accessible to users 24/7.
